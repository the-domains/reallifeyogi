What is Real Life Yogi?

Yoga is "jugit" in Sanskrit, which means "to unite." Therefore, the purpose of yoga is to unite polarities (good and bad, light and darkness, joy and sadness, and etc...) and achieve balance. 

Yoga is not merely a physical exercise; it is a way of living.
I was introduced to yoga when I was about 25 years old. I sought out things like pilates and yoga to deal with chronic pain from a car accident. These practices helped me achieve balance, but for a long time I only saw them as "workout" to manage my body. 

But then a turning point came, when I discovered Kundalini Yoga. I was 41, and the whole new world opened up for me.
Kundalini Yoga is yoga of awareness. It utilizes many different elements such as asana (postures and movement), breathing, meditation, mantras, sound, mudras, and etc... 

In Kundalini Yoga you will experience many repetitive movements or holding a particular posture for a duration of time, which is designed to impact your nervous and glandular systems directly. It can be practiced by the young and old, and people with limited physical flexibility and stamina. With Kundalini Yoga, you can achieve clear and immediate results physically, mentally, and spiritually. 

The core message of Kundalini Yoga (to me) is "Truth is within you." We live in a constant state of information overload; we oftentimes find ourselves overwhelmed as to what to think and what to do. Kundalini Yoga gives us an opportunity to look within ourselves and to gain insights on the self, our relationships with people, and the world that we live in. 

Kundalini yoga is an art of living life with the joy and rigor of a newborn, while having an access to our wisdom at the same time.
Real Life Yogi is for people like you and I who achieve balance and fulfillment with all the richness and messiness that the life brings. We will not do yoga in order to escape. Rather we engage in the eternal dialogue of yoga in order to live to the fullest by being ourselves right here, right now. 

Through live workshops, virtual classes, private coaching, and initiating conversations, we aim to do our part in creating a more resilient and compassionate world.
