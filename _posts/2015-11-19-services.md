1\. Personal Coaching
Coaching services for re-inventing your life and personal branding. Together we identify the foundation (your life purpose and values) of who you are and re-align your life with this foundation at the core. Our recommended program is a six week coaching series to achieve specific, measurable results. A la carte sessions are also available.

2\. Special events and workshops
We provide workshops and retreat programs focused on Kundalini yoga and other self-healing techniques in Japan and in the U.S.A. 

3\. Kundalini yoga at work
In recent years many U.S. corporations have introduced meditation in their workplaces as part of mindful leadership training programs. At RealLifeYogi we provide Kundalini Yoga (moving meditations) as part of leadership and awareness building programs for small-to-medium companies.
